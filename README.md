parcel_url = b'http://demo.econt.com/e-econt/xml_parcel_import.php'

econt = RemoteEcontXml(service_url, parcel_url,  # Remote API urls
                       'itpartner', 'itpartner', # Username and password
                       CurlTransfer)

print(econt.offices('София')) # The argument is optional
print(econt.countries())
print(econt.cities_regions())
print(econt.cities_quarters())
# etc... See method signatures

# See either __init__.py or the Econt official docs for more
# information on shipment request data
loadings = [{
    'sender': ...   # Sender details
    'receiver': ... # Receiver address
    'shipment': ... # Shipment data
    'services': ...
    'payment': ...
}]

system = {
    # 'response_type': ... # You don't have to set this, the lib does it anyway
    'only_calculate': 1,
    'validate': 1
}

print(econt.shipping(loadings, system))
```

##Roadmap
The library supports all calls needed for a normal delivery experience.  I plan
to further enhance the code base and its functionality according to the needs
of some projects of ours.  But if you find it limited yet, please feel free to
contribute.

##License
*Lesser GNU Public License*  
In brief: You you can use the library for anything, but, if you change
the code, you have to share your changes under compatible license and
(of course) notify me of them.
